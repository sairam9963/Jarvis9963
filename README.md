JARVIS: Advancing AGI Research Through a Collaborative System  JARVIS is dedicated to advancing the exploration of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by delivering cutting-edge research to the broader community. Our system operates as a collaborative framework, integrating a large language model (LLM) as the central controller and multiple specialized expert models sourced from the Hugging Face Hub as execution modules.
The system follows a structured four-stage workflow:

Task Planning: The LLM (ChatGPT) analyzes user requests, interprets their intent, and decomposes them into distinct, manageable tasks.
Model Selection: Based on the planned tasks, the LLM selects appropriate expert models from the Hugging Face Hub by evaluating their descriptions and capabilities.
Task Execution: The selected expert models are invoked to process their respective tasks, with results aggregated and returned to the LLM.
Response Generation: The LLM synthesizes outputs from all expert models, integrating their predictions into a coherent and comprehensive response.
This collaborative approach enhances task efficiency, leveraging the strengths of multiple AI models to produce refined, high-quality responses.
